This project extended from the tutorial [Ruby's Adventure: 2D Beginner](https://learn.unity.com/project/ruby-s-2d-rpg)

It's team project. We are new to Unity or barely experienced to Unity, we tried our best. One big problem is we don't have an artist so the solution is using assets from opengameart.org. I really appreciate and very grateful to them.
