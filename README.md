Playable link is [here at simmer.io](https://simmer.io/@IcianTun/rubyadventureplusplus) or [here at my GitHub Page](https://iciantun.github.io/RubyAdventureplusplus/rubyadventure.html)

This project extended from the tutorial [Ruby's Adventure: 2D Beginner](https://learn.unity.com/project/ruby-s-2d-rpg)

It's team project. We were new to Unity or barely experienced to Unity, we tried our best. One big problem was we don't have an artist so the solution is using assets from opengameart.org. I really appreciated and very grateful to them.
